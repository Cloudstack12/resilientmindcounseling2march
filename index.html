                    Physical techniques for stress management are effective in reducing anxiety and promoting relaxation. These practices help reduce muscle tension and promote relaxation, decreasing stress levels. Also, progressive muscle relaxation, deep breathing, and massage therapy can help reduce stress levels.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <b>Exercise</b> – is one of the most common and effective techniques for reducing stress. Physical activity promotes the release of <b>endorphins, natural mood-enhancing chemicals that help reduce anxiety and improve mood.</b>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <b>Deep Breathing Exercises</b> – deep breathing exercises involve inhaling slowly and deeply, holding the breath for a few seconds, and exhaling slowly. This breathing can lower the heart rate, decrease blood pressure, and improve circulation. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <b>Progressive Muscle Relaxation</b> – This technique involves tensing and relaxing various muscle groups in your body, one at a time, to help release physical tension and improve relaxation. The idea is to focus on each muscle group and consciously contract it for a few seconds, then remove it and feel the difference in relaxation. 
                </p>

                    Stress is a natural and unavoidable part of life, but certain situations can trigger it more than others. One common source of stress is work-related issues, such as a heavy workload, deadlines, and conflicts with coworkers or managers. Financial problems, such as debt or unemployment, can cause significant stress. Family conflicts, relationship issues, and major life changes, such as divorce or the death of a loved one, are other everyday stressors. Health problems, both physical and mental, can also lead to stress.

                <p>
                    Happy events can cause stress even though they are supposed to bring joy and happiness. This is because happy events like getting married, starting a new job, or having a baby come with a lot of changes that can be overwhelming. You may feel pressure to feel happy and excited, but the truth is that these events can be stressful too. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Additionally, these events come with new responsibilities and expectations, which can be overwhelming. It’s important to recognize that while happy events are exciting, they can also be stressful and require proper self-care and stress management techniques to help mitigate any potential adverse effects. 
                </p>
